              ❥ We took some resolutions: 365 photos, 365 days 📸<br>
              ❥ You said: If I interlock my hands and left thumb comes above right thumb then it's a love marriage. And it is. 💕<br>

              ❥ We had a fight about me not giving you enough time (mostly you talk all day with Deepa and missed me). But we resolved it quite soon. 💔<br>
              ❥ We both were happy when I booked a ticket to India 😊<br>
              ❥ You asked me to bring maple leaves with me 🍁<br>

              ❥ Babbu, Guddu, Ladoo, Bub, Sweetheart, Sweetie, Cutie, Love, Jaan, Happiness, Priye, Cutie pie, Jaana, Sweetu, Silly, Mine. 💖<br>
              ❥ We decided to celebrate Rakhi with you with मंगलसूत्र, and you showed me the Rakhi that you made for your bhiya. 🎉<br>
              ❥ We started the month quite romantic and you said "ishh" many times. That was so sweet every time. 😊<br>
              ❥ Because of masale, you sneezed 7 times. 😄<br>
              ❥ I sent you those Pikachu vale clothes. 🐱<br>
              ❥ 🤭 UK me, ik UK me, ik UK that ik UK me. 🤔<br>
              ❥ We had this line "why settle for less" for everything we do for each other. And you asked me for a promise, that I won't use this phrase for any other girlfriend after you. And I promised you that will be our line. 💬<br>
              ❥ I was removing access of people from my Google Drive. When I asked you about it, you wished to stay. 📂<br>
              ❥ Good morning happiness! ♥️ I am feeling fresh and fine. Bit romantic as well. I wish you play with success this day. Your daily targets get completed in time. And we have a cheerful night. ♥️ Stay focused. Sky is the limit. Love you. 🌟<br>
              ❥ You started watching Naruto. 🍥<br>
              ❥ My visa expired in August, so now I have to apply for a visa again to go to Germany. ✈️<br>

            <h2>मेरा हमसफ़र</h2>
            <p class="color-contrast-medium">
              ❥ I got my visa appointment booked for the second week. ✈️<br>
              ❥ You called me laddoo and I called you maahi, and I felt it cute together. 🍬💑<br>
              ❥ "मेरा सफर अच्छा है लेकिन, मेरा हमसफ़र उससे भी अच्छा है! #meribhoomi❤️" (My journey is good, but my companion is even better! #mylove❤️) 🌍❤️<br>
              ❥ I sent you the game "Open Puzzle Box." 🎮<br>
              ❥ Tumhare lecture shuru hogaye the, tumhe subah he jaldi uthna utha tha. (Your lectures had started, you had to wake up early in the morning.) 🌅<br>
              ❥ Life was boring in times of COVID, we got fewer topics to talk about. 😔<br>
              ❥ I and Mum had a conversation about you, related to marriage and showed her your photos, and she agreed for you on the very first day itself. Initially, she said "sunder nahi hai" in chemistry lab reference. 👩‍👧‍👦<br>
              ❥ We had a little discussion about Anmol's case. 📝<br>
              ❥ I had my mood off due to some rental issues in Germany. 😞<br>
              ❥ "Na Naruto kun" tum hinata ho or Deepanshu Naruto -_- (No, Naruto kun, you are Hinata and Deepanshu is Naruto -_-) 🍥<br>
              ❥ I was a little tensed because mera visa nahi aaraha tha, main Germany nahi jaa paraha tha, mere pass koi ghar nahi tha, exam bhi nahi de paaya kuch kuch. (I was a little tensed because my visa was not coming, I couldn't go to Germany, I didn't have any house, couldn't give some exams.) 😓<br>
              ❥ You asked me if I am happy, you felt like you bore me, which I assured is not the case. Then we had a discussion where you said I only talk 45 minutes or 1 hour a day which is too less. We had fewer topics due to Naruto, PUBG, and COVID. 🗣️<br>
              ❥ Then we talked about challenges of our relationship, long distances, we being in different phases of life. Responsibilities and comfort zones, we share no common interests and things like that. 💬<br>
              ❥ But we finished the month quite happy. Tumhare ghar ke pass COVID ka case agaya tha par bachhe gali ke fir bhi khel rahe the, or tumhari mummy ki tabiyat thodi kharab thi month end ke pass to ghar ka kaam tum sambhal rahi thi. (There was a COVID case near your house but the kids were still playing on the streets, and your mom was a bit unwell towards the end of the month so you were handling the housework.) 🏠<br>

            <p class="color-contrast-medium">
              ❥ It was the 2nd of Oct. And we were talking quite late at night. And I said tum bs routine kharab karoge mera, and you said Jisne routine kharab nahi kiya thoda toh kahan ki gf. (You'll just disrupt my routine, and you said, "Who hasn't disrupted the routine, can't be called a girlfriend.") 🌙<br>
              ❥ Then over drank Himanshu tried to talk dirty with you. 🍻<br>
              ❥ 🙈 Umm... I cannot bring you sleep, tired fellow, but I can assure you sweetness in your sleep. 🤗<br>
              ❥ You felt really sorry that you can't meet me because you had no reason to go out of home due to post-COVID restrictions. Then I suggested you to talk positively and compensate in other good ways. 😔<br>
              ❥ "The sun is up, the sky is blue, Good morning love, I was thinking about you." ☀️<br>
              ❥ You told about your not so good college friends, tumhare college me elections hue the and most of them applied without telling you, including Tarini. You also wanted to apply. 🎓<br>
              ❥ You told that you are not that happy in the relationship, I agreed, you said all negative piled up and you cannot go out and meet me, so it feels like continuous long-distance vibes. 💔<br>
              ❥ We talked about brustle. 🗣️<br>
              ❥ You both made Simran ka sketch. 🎨<br>
              ❥ I wish to kiss your heart then neck then heart then butt then heart then lips with the soul being kissed is constant. 💋<br>
              ❥ You said I am your Bugs Bunny. 🐰<br>

              ❥ Got COVID, you said I should get hot from love not fever. 🤒❤️<br>
              ❥ On करवाचौथ, tumne bhot achi mehndi lagayi thi mummy ki or apni bhi jisme tumne "P" bhi likha tha. (On Karva Chauth, you applied very nice henna on Mum's hands and yours too, where you also wrote "P.") 🌼<br>
              ❥ Ps: I always have a gut feeling you'll become very successful in the future. 🌸🙈<br>
              ❥ Farz hai mera betu tumhe motivate karna aur cheer karna. (It's my duty, my dear, to motivate and cheer you up.) 🌸<br>
              ❥ I asked you to propose to me and you did not propose to me. You said no, you said you have rights on me. 💍<br>
              ❥ We had a long discussion about our relationship. Do we want it, where did we go wrong. Are we willing to improve it and take effort. I guess because of this thing only we just stopped expecting things from each other. And I guess that's where we went wrong. 💬<br>
              ❥ You finished your exams and we had a new energy. Still sleeping peacefully I guess. God bless you, bacha. Have a good morning and a wonderful day. 🌸<br>
              ❥ We played Outwit in a group and you guys really liked the game. 🎲<br>
              ❥ Hehe, the following night you said you don't want to split your time in the game so you said no, we should talk. I really liked your idea and opinion. 🗨️<br>
              ❥ You dressed so good for Diwali. You look so pink in some pictures. Like wo hote nahi ek dum chote babies jaise pink nahi hoye ek dum cute and delicate. 🎆🥺<br>
              ❥ We had a little dense forest after me requesting it for so long. Hehe, it was my Diwali gift. And I was so excited about it. 🌳🎁<br>
              ❥ I love it when you strategically show your cleavage. This makes you a lovely girlfriend and gives you an extra edge. It always makes me feel a little warm but I never feel like you're exposing, that's really lovely. 💖<br>
              ❥ Someone proposed to you at that time. I guess he was Deepanshu or Aditya from school. Not sure we have talked about it on call. 💬<br>
              ❥ You said you like being patted, I said I will pat you a lot. 🤗<br>
              ❥ "Good night, in the sky, stars are bright. May the moon's silvery beam brings you sweet dreams. Close your eyes now and rest, may these hours be blessed until the sky is bright with dawn and you wake up with a yawn." 🌟🌛<br>
              ❥ "Everything that's a part of nature is breathtakingly beautiful. The sunsets, the waterfall, the wilderness; and you." 🥺✨<br>
              ❥ "I love you jaan. I hope you missed me. And I wish you wake up with a good mood. All the love and support to you. Hope you have a great day ahead. Do all your pending works." ♥️🌸🥰🙈<br>
              ❥ You wanted me to see in a gallace, you said I will look super duper hot. 🔥<br>
              ❥ You went to some function and wore a drape saree. 🎉<br>
              ❥ I sent my photo to you in a gallace and you super liked it. 📸👍<br>

              ❥ Both of us were busy at a wedding last November, so we started exchanging photos and memories. 📸<br>
              ❥ You used to call me "BAKA" and "Cuddle bear" at that time. 🐻<br>
              ❥ You had your uni exam in December. 📚<br>
              ❥ I saved your number as ghr wali. 📱<br>
              ❥ You finished watching Naruto. 📺<br>

              ❥ I feel like someone makes two high ponytails when she wants to pretend to be a cute evil under the blanket (you did that day). 🐰<br>
              ❥ I associated the color light pink with you, expressing Pyaar ka kr shanti ka mila jula bhav. 💕<br>
              ❥ Thank you for always being sweet with me. I love you. You said this after you couldn't meet me for months due to lockdown. 🌸<br>
              ❥ We had a boys trip planned. 🧳<br>
              ❥ Tu chalne vali ban, teri kasam, sirf tu hi hogi, jisse khud utha kr, duniya ki sair krva dunga. 🚀<br>
              ❥ All the best my love. Have a great trip. And hope you have a safe journey. Be careful. Drink enough water. Carry a sanitizer and wash your hands frequently (I know you would be careless about it). Love you. Good morning. ✨🌻🤭<br>
              ❥ You are so beautiful to me. Can't you see? You're everything I have hoped for, you're everything I need. 🎶<br>
              ❥ I sent you a picture from the trip, you wanted to study in the morning and I distracted you. 📷<br>
              ❥ Pranay: 🤫 want to quench my love + lust thirst ? Bhoom: Praannnnaaayyyyyy Pranay: Hanji Pranay: Bhoommmiiiiiiiii Bhoom: Idiot Why do you make me blush Pranay: Cos I wanna adore u Bhoom: You have me. 😬♥️<br>
