              ❥ Your new semester with 2 chem labs, I had my exams approaching 💖<br>
              ❥ We planned to dance on the song "A Thousand Years" 💃<br>
              ❥ We took some resolutions: 365 photos, 365 days 📸<br>
              ❥ You said: If I interlock my hands and left thumb comes above right thumb then it's a love marriage. And it is. 💕<br>
              ❥ Dibbe me dibba, dibbe me cake, meri bhoomi, laakho me ek 🎂<br>
              ❥ We had a fight about me not giving you enough time (mostly you talk all day with Deepa and missed me). But we resolved it quite soon. 💔<br>
              ❥ We both were happy when I booked a ticket to India 😊<br>
              ❥ You asked me to bring maple leaves with me 🍁<br>
              ❥ We talked about cuddles, what I like, what you like, how my dad used to do 🤗<br>
              ❥ We talked about the long to-do list of things to do together (btw Lotus Temple is still pending) 🌸<br>
              ❥ "What if it falls" (yellow heart) video call 💛<br>
              ❥ Some nights I said I won't talk due to exams and we ended up in 2-hour-long video calls 🌙<br>
              ❥ Deepa (and Aditya) proposed to you 💍<br>
              ❥ I confessed: I felt your hug protective 💖<br>

              ❥ I called you the third bhatura of my plate, dekh kr aisa lgta ki mann to bhra hai pr pait mahi bhra. 🍽️<br>
              ❥ VCed for the first time till 1 cloth. 📞<br>
              ❥ Gosh, sometimes I really wish that my mom knows about you and she likes you too and be casual about it like if I make plans with you. 🤞<br>
              ❥ We visited some fest together. 🎪<br>
              ❥ Still, you call me tu, and we are maintaining a photo streak. 📸<br>
              ❥ We met on Valentine's Day (8/10 meet) thoda sa conscious, thoda sa gussa, or hamari ladai hui thi uss din (due to Saiyam), and I walked with my hand on the waist. 💑<br>
              ❥ I visited Vrindavan and Agra. 🕌<br>
              ❥ Then we celebrated your birthday together. 🎉<br>
              ❥ We had a home visit, we watched a movie together (song: Love Me Like You Do). 🎥<br>
              ❥ We said we want to give each other all the happiness we can. 💖<br>

              Together, we're like a double rainbow. Surely we can have a lot of
              fun When things are light and bright, like the sun Those people
              are like us, but duller. We have fun in every colour Rain or shine
              or wind or hail, we're side by side, without fail We sail through
              the air, two of a kind .So awesome we blow people's minds
