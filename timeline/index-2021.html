          <p class="color-contrast-medium">
            ❥ This month started with your cry; there was some family issue in
            your home 🏠<br />
            ❥ I had a little changed schedule; Khushi moved in with us at that
            time 🐱<br />
            ❥ Then I found a few days where we started talking, and there comes
            1 to 2 cute and flirty texts and then direct, "I hope you enjoyed"
            or "It was good" or "I hope I did not take much of your time" 💭<br />
            ❥ We gave each other names, Sweet Dish and Midnight Snack 🌙<br />
            ❥ I wish I could be available for you all the time and not give you
            any time to overthink 🕰️<br />
            ❥ I formed a new circle with Saravni, Akash, Shalini, and us, so I
            was not available a few nights in between, so we used to talk early
            mornings sometimes ☀️<br />
            ❥ Also, you started spending your nights on Clubhouse 🎶<br />
            ❥ I asked you if we can clean up snaps because sometimes I have to
            show our normal snaps to someone 🧹<br />
            ❥ You were selected for a Blue Butterfly project for mental health
            🦋<br />
            ❥ I would be really happy if I could just repay you in kinds for all
            the efforts you did for me and all the efforts you put in this
            relationship. It looks like I have done really few compared to
            efforts you did for me. You always give me one more reason to be
            with you. I just wanna be called yours. 🌸<br />
            ❥ It's your shadow I am embracing in 🌘<br />
            ❥ I figured out a fact: you are an unavoidable truth of me 📚<br />
            ❥ And you replied with: "We are just being one and we won't even
            realize when we will be so embedded in each other that we will be
            one" 🤝<br />
            ❥ First inappropriate text of Simran 🤭<br />
            ❥ You asked me what will I do if you are sexual, then I said I will
            not marry you 💍<br />
            ❥ You wished me Happy Father's Day, "Daddy," for the first time
            🎈<br />
            ❥ You got a surprise, jo tumne DTU ka exam bhra tha uski exam ki
            date was quite near and you didn't know 🤯<br />
            ❥ Then we had a few days in our life where we both were busy in
            exams and we talked less, but both felt satisfied at the end of the
            day with our progress 📈<br />
            ❥ Aditya Bh. did your handwriting analysis and you liked that stuff
            ✍️<br />
            ❥ You said that one bad thing about our relationship is that you
            cannot correct your sleep schedule 😴<br />

          ❥ Eppp 🙈 Can you please put all the elastics you had on your waist to your thighs? 😜<br>
          ❥ 🤭🤭 Ahem ahem 
          Trust me baby 
          We ain't far from drinking champagne one calm night in our small house, watching the starry sky, talking about life in the cool breeze, and then taking a hot water bath together 🛁✨<br>
          ❥ At some days, I realize if I could give you a kiss for every special moment we didn't get to spend together, I feel it'll take hours to complete that 🥺
          And you make our long-distance bearable ♥️🥺<br>
          ❥ Happy 0th birthday to Pranit 🎂🎉<br>

        <h2>Mayank's Confession</h2>
        <p class="color-contrast-medium">
          ❥ No big text at my birthday 🎂<br>
          ❥ A million times I needed you, 
          A million times I cried, 
          If love alone can save you, 
          You will never die
          *If love alone can save you*
          *You will never die* 💔<br>
          ❥ It will break my heart to lose you 
          But you will never go alone
          Part of me will go with you 
          When God will take you home 
          *Part of me will go with you*
          *When God will take you home* 😢<br>
          ❥ Mayank confessed that he loves you on 7 Dec. 😊 and that is why I never feel comfortable with you talking with your friends 🙈 I just did not want to say this but I saw all this coming 🥺<br>
          ❥ 🤭 Take your time betu to get over stress. Handle stuff your ways and make Mayank understand 😊 If you need any support, I am always there 🤗<br>
          ❥ 🙈 The 2 most terrifying thoughts I have are: 
          Plane crashing when I am on it
          And you leaving me 😨<br>
          ❥ We had little fight on and off and frustration exchange. Basically because you were busy with Mayank lately. And I am not getting attention 😔<br>
          ❥ Kisi karan se hi kehta hu mai bhoo(me) terko 
          The "me" here is important 
          🥺 You hold me baby 🤗<br>
          ❥ Ahem ahem 💋
          First time we see a bathtub together and if taking bath together is possible. 🤫 I want to assure you that you will be getting it there and then.... No exceptions ..... Full stop 💛😘🤭<br>
          ❥ 🤦‍♂️ Dhyaan se sunn 
          In the world of undercover agents, I want to be your underwear agent and find out which color you wear, which size you wear, and what's inside and have 100 photos of that 💋💋<br>
